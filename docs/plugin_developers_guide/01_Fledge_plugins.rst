.. =============================================


Fledge makes extensive use of plugin components to extend the base functionality of the platform. In particular, plugins are used to extend the set of sensors and actuators that Fledge supports, the set of services to which Fledge will push accumulated data gathered from those sensors and the mechanism by which Fledge buffers data internally.

This chapter presents the plugins available for Fledge, how to write and use new plugins to support different sensors, protocols, historians and storage devices. It will guide you through the process and entry points that are required for the various different type of plugin.


Fledge Plugins
===============

In this version of Fledge you have three types of plugins:

- **South Plugins** - They are responsible for communication between Fledge and the sensors and actuators they support. Each instance of a Fledge South microservice will use a plugin for the actual communication to the sensors or actuators that that instance of the South microservice supports.
- **North Plugins** - They are responsible for taking reading data passed to them from the South bound service and doing any necessary conversion to the data and providing the protocol to send that converted data to a north-side task.
- **Storage Plugins** - They sit between the Storage microservice and the physical data storage mechanism that stores the Fledge configuration and readings data. Storage plugins differ from other plugins in that they interface to a storage system which is written in C/C++ rather than Python, however they share the same common attributes and entry points that the Python based plugins must support.

Installing New Plugins
----------------------

As a general rule and unless the documentation states otherwise, plugins should be installed in two ways:

- When the plugin is available as **source code**, it should be installed when **Fledge is not running**. |br| This is the recommended method because you may want to manually move the plugin code into the right location where Fledge is installed, add pre-requisites and execute the REST commands necessary to start the plugin.
- When the plugin is available as **package**, it should be installed when **Fledge is running**. |br| This is the required method because the package executed pre and post-installation tasks that require Fledge to run. 

In general, Fledge must be restarted when a new plugin has been installed.

For example, this is the command to use to install the *OpenWeather* South plugin:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo systemctl status fledge.service
