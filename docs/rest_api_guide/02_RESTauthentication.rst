*******************************
REST API Users & Authentication
*******************************

Fledge supports a number of different authentication schemes for use of the REST API

  - Unauthenticated or Optional authentication. There is no requirement for any authentication to occur with the Fledge system to use the API. A user may authenticate if they desire, but it is not required.

  - Username/Password authentication. Authentication is required and the user chooses to authenticate using a username and password.

  - Certificate based authentication. Authentication is required and the user presents a token issued using a certificate in order to authenticate.

Authentication API
==================

Login
-----

``POST /fledge/login`` - Create a login session token that can be used for future calls to the API


**Request Payload** 

If the user is connecting with a user name and a password then a JSON structure should be passed as the payload providing the following key/value pairs.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 50 30
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Key Name
      - Type
      - Description
      - Example
    * - username
      - string
      - The username of the user attempting to login
      - admin
    * - password
      - string
      - The plain text password of the user attempting to login
      - fledge

**Response Payload**

The response payload is an authentication token that should be included in all future calls to the API. This token will be included in the header of the subsequent requests as the value of the property authorization.

**Example**

Assuming the authentication provider is a username and password provider.

.. code-block:: console

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/fledge/login -d'
    {
      "username" : "admin",
      "password" : "fledge"
    }'

Would return an authentication token

.. code-block:: json 

    {
      "message": "Logged in successfully",
      "uid": 1,
      "token": "********************",
      "admin": true
    }

Subsequent calls should carry an HTTP header with the authorization token given in this response.

.. code-block:: console

   curl -H "authorization: <token>" http://localhost:8081/fledge/ping

Alternatively a certificate based authentication can be used with the user presenting a certificate instead of the JSON payload shown above to the ``/fledge/login`` endpoint.

.. code-block:: console

   curl -T user.cert -X POST http://localhost:8081/fledge/login --insecure

The payload returned is the same as for username and password based authentication.

.. note::

   The examples above have been shown using HTTP as the transport, however if authentication is in use then it would normally be expected to use HTTPS to encrypt the communication.

Logout
------

``PUT /fledge/logout`` - Terminate the current login session and invalidate the authentication token

Ends to login session for the current user and invalidates the token given in the header.

``PUT /fledge/{user_id}/logout`` - Terminate the login session for user's all active sessions.

The administrator may terminate the login session of another user.

.. code-block:: console

   curl -H "authorization: <token>" -X PUT http://localhost:8081/fledge/{user_id}/logout
