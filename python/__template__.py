"""Example Google style docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `Google Python
Style Guide`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections are created
with a section header and a colon followed by a block of indented text.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python __template__.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Attributes:
    module_level_variable1 (int): Module level variables may be documented in
        either the ``Attributes`` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
        one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
        with it.

.. todo::

   * For module TODOs in docstring
   * To show in readthedocs.io, you have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension and enable
     todo_include_todos in conf.py

    Function parameters should be documented in the ``Args`` section. The name

    is optional, but should be included if not obvious.

    If \*args or \*\*kwargs are accepted,

    The format for a parameter is::

        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Returns:
