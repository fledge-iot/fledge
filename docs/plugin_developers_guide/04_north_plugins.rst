North Plugins
=============

North plugins are used in North tasks and microservices to extract data buffered in Fledge and send it Northbound, i.e. to a server or a service in the Cloud or in an Enterprise data center. We currently have two North plugins, one to send data to an OSIsoft PI Server and one to the OSIsoft Cloud Service.


The OMF Plugin
--------------

The OMF Plugin is used by a North task to send data to an OSIsoft PI server via a PI Connector Relay or PI Web API, it can also send to Edge Data Store or OSIsoft Cloud Services. All these destinations share a single protocol for communication, OMF. *OMF* stands for OSIsoft Message Format, it is the JSON format defined by OSIsoft to send IoT data to a PI server via a Connector Relay server.

The plugin is designed to send two streams of data:

- The data collected by South microservices and buffered into Fledge
- The statistics generated by Fledge

The streams are managed by two different North tasks using the same plugin, but with a different configuration. The two tasks are registered in the list of scheduled jobs and they can be identified using the ``schedule`` API call:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sX GET   http://locahost:8081/fledge/schedule
  {
    "schedules": [
      {
        "id": "ef8bd42b-da9f-47c4-ade8-751ce9a504be",
        "name": "OMF to PI north",
        "processName": "north_c",
        "type": "INTERVAL",
        "repeat": 30.0,
        "time": 0,
        "day": null,
        "exclusive": true,
        "enabled": false
      },
      {
        "id": "27501b35-e0cd-4340-afc2-a4465fe877d6",
        "name": "Stats OMF to PI north",
        "processName": "north_c",
        "type": "INTERVAL",
        "repeat": 30.0,
        "time": 0,
        "day": null,
        "exclusive": true,
        "enabled": true
      },
    ...
    ]
  }

The output of API call above shows three interesting tasks: the two tasks associated to the OMF plugin, the one to send data (*OMF to PI north*) and the one to send statistics (*Stats OMF to PI north*).
 
The two scheduled tasks are associated to two configuration items that can be retrieved using the ``category`` API call. The items are named ``OMF to PI north`` and ``Stats OMF to PI north``.

  ...}
  $

In order to activate the tasks, you must change their status. First you must collect their id (from the GET method of the ``schedule`` API call), then you must use the IDs with the PUT method of the same call:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sX PUT http://localhost:8081/fledge/schedule/ef8bd42b-da9f-47c4-ade8-751ce9a504be -d '{ "enabled" : true}'
  {
    "schedule": {
      "id": "ef8bd42b-da9f-47c4-ade8-751ce9a504be",
      "name": "OMF to PI north",
      "processName": "north_c",
      "type": "INTERVAL",
      "repeat": 30,
      "time": 0,
      "day": null,
      "exclusive": true,
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
  $ curl -sX PUT http://localhost:8081/fledge/schedule/27501b35-e0cd-4340-afc2-a4465fe877d6 -d '{ "enabled" : true}'
  {
    "schedule": {
      "id": "27501b35-e0cd-4340-afc2-a4465fe877d6",
      "name": "Stats OMF to PI north",
      "processName": "north_c",
      "type": "INTERVAL",
      "repeat": 30,
      "time": 0,
      "day": null,
      "exclusive": true,
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
  $

      - integer
      - 0
      - Identifies the specific stream to handle and the related information, among them the ID of the last object streamed.


The last parameter to review is the *OMF Type*. The call is the GET method ``fledge/category/OMF_TYPES``, which returns an integer value that identifies the measurement type:


.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sX GET http://localhost:8081/fledge/category/OMF_TYPES
  {
    "type-id": {
      "description": "Identify sensor and measurement types",
      "type": "integer",
      "default": "0001",
      "value": "0001"
    }
  }
  $

If you change the value, you can easily identify the set of data sent to and then stored into PI.
 

Changing the OMF Plugin Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you send data to the PI server, it is likely that you need to apply more changes to the configuration. The most important items to change are:

- **URL** : the URL to the PI Connector Relay OMF. It is usually composed by the name or address of the Windows server where the Connector Relay service is running, the port associated to the service and the ingress/messages API call. The communication is via HTTPS protocol.
- **producerToken** : the token provided by the Data Collection Manager when the PI administrator sets the use of Fledge. 
- **type-id** : the measurement type for the stream of data.
- **source** : this parameter should be set to *readings* (default) when the plugin is used to send data collected by South microservices, and to *statistics* when the plugin is used to send Fledge statistics to the PI system.

An example of the changes to apply to the plugins to send data to the PI system is available here `here <../building_fledge/06_testing.html#sending-greetings-to-the-northern-hemisphere>`_.


Data in the PI System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the North plugins have been set properly, you should expect to see data automatically sent and stored in the PI Server. More specifically, the process of the plugin is the following:

- **Assets** buffered in Fledge are stored as *elements* in the PI System. 
  - *PI Asset Framework* is automatically update with the new assets.
  - JSON objects captured as part of the *reading* in Fledge become *attributes* in the PI Data Archive
- The **Producer Token** is used to authenticate and create the hierarchy of elements in the *PI Asset Framework*
- The configuration object named as **Static Data** is added as a set of *attributes* in the PI Data Archive
