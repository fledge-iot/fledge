Introduction to Fledge
=======================

Fledge is an open sensor-to-cloud data fabric for the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects people and systems to the information they need to operate their business.  It provides a scalable, secure, robust infrastructure for collecting data from sensors, processing data at the edge and transporting data to historian and other management systems. Fledge can operate over the unreliable, intermittent and low bandwidth connections often found in IoT applications.

Fledge is implemented as a collection of microservices which include:

- Core services, including security, monitoring, and storage
- Data transformation and alerting services
- South services: Collect data from sensors and other Fledge systems
- North services: Transmit data to historians and other systems
- Edge data processing applications

Services can easily be developed and incorporated into the Fledge framework. The Fledge Developer Guides describe how to do this.

Installing Fledge
==================

Fledge is extremely lightweight and can run on inexpensive edge devices, sensors and actuator boards.  For the purposes of this manual, we assume that all services are running on a Raspberry Pi running the Raspbian operating system. Be sure your system has plenty of storage available for data readings.

If your system does not have Raspbian pre-installed, you can find instructions on downloading and installing it at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/.  After installing Raspbian, ensure you have the latest updates by executing the following commands on your Fledge server::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get update

You can obtain Fledge in two ways:

- Dianomic Systems offers pre-built, certified binaries of Fledge for Debian using either Intel or ARM architectures. This is the recommended method, especially for new users. You can download these from https://Fledge.readthedocs.io/en/master/92_downloads.html.
- As source code from https://github.com/fledge-iot/.  Instructions for downloading and building Fledge source code can be found in the Fledge Developer’s Guide

In general, Fledge installation will require the following packages:

- Fledge core
- Fledge user interface
- One or more Fledge South services
- One or more Fledge North service (OSI PI and OCS north services are included in Fledge core)

Installing Fledge packages
###########################

SSH into the system that will host Fledge services. For each Fledge package that you choose to install, type the following command::

  sudo apt -y install PackageName

The key packages to install are the Fledge core and the Fledge User Interface::

  sudo apt -y install ./fledge-1.4.1-armhf.deb
  sudo apt -y install ./fledge-gui-1.4.0-dev.deb

You will need to install one of more South plugins to acquire data.  You can either do this now or when you are adding the data source. For example, to install the plugin for the Sense HAT sensor board, type::

  sudo apt -y install ./fledge-south-sensehat-1.0-armhf.deb

You may also need to install one or more North plugins to transmit data.  Support for OSIsoft PI and OCS are included with the Fledge core package, so you don't need to install anything more if you are sending data to only these systems.

Checking package installation
#############################

To check what packages have been installed, ssh into your host system and use the dpkg command::

  dpkg -l | grep 'fledge'

Starting and stopping Fledge
=============================

Fledge administration is performed using the “fledge” command line utility.  You must first ssh into the host system.  The Fledge utility is installed by default in /usr/local/fledge/bin.

The following command options are available:

  - **Start:** Start the Fledge system
  - **Stop:** Stop the Fledge system
  - **Status:** Lists currently running Fledge services and tasks
  - **Reset:** Delete all data and configuration and return Fledge to factory settings
  - **Kill:** Kill Fledge services that have not correctly responded to Stop
  - **Help:** Describe Fledge options

For example, to start the Fledge system, open a session to the Fledge device and type::

/usr/local/fledge/bin/fledge start

Troubleshooting Fledge
#######################

Fledge logs status and error messages to syslog.  To troubleshoot a Fledge installation using this information, open a session to the Fledge server and type::

  grep -a 'fledge' /var/log/syslog | tail -n 20

Running the Fledge GUI
=======================

Fledge offers an easy-to-use, browser-based GUI.  To access the GUI, open your browser and enter the IP address of the Fledge server into the address bar.  This will display the Fledge dashboard.

You can easily use the Fledge UI to monitor multiple Fledge servers.  To view and manage a different server, click "Settings" in the left menu bar. In the "Connection Setup" pane, enter the IP address and port number for the new server you wish to manage.  Click the "Set the URL & Restart" button to switch the UI to the new server.

If you are managing a very lightweight server or one that is connected via a slow network link, you may want to reduce the UI update frequency to minimize load on the server and network.  You can adjust this rate in the "GUI Settings" pane of the Settings screen.  While the graph rate and ping rate can be adjusted individually, in general you should set them to the same value.

Fledge Dashboard
#################
+-------------+
| |dashboard| |
+-------------+

This screen provides an overview of Fledge operations.  You can customize the information and time frames displayed on this screen using the drop-down menus in the upper right corner.  The information you select will be displayed in a series of graphs.

You can choose to view a graph of any of the sensor reading being collected by the Fledge system.  In addition, you can view graphs of the following system-wide information:

  - **Readings:** The total number of data readings collected by Fledge since system boot
  - **Buffered:** The number of data readings currently stored by the system
  - **Discarded:** Number of data readings discarded before being buffered (due to data errors, for example)
  - **Unsent:** Number of data readings that were not sent successfully
  - **Purged:** The total number of data readings that have been purged from the system
  - **Unsnpurged:** The number of data readings that were purged without being sent to a North service.

Managing Data Sources
=====================
+------------------+
| |south_services| |
+------------------+

Data sources are managed from the South Services screen.  To access this screen, click on “South” from the menu bar on the left side of any screen.

The South Services screen displays the status of all data sources in the Fledge system.  Each data source will display its status, the data assets it is providing, and the number of readings that have been collected.

Adding Data Sources
###################

To add a data source, you will first need to install the plugin for that sensor type.  If you have not already done this, open a terminal session to your Fledge server.  Download the package for the plugin and enter::

  sudo apt -y install PackageName

Once the plugin is installed return to the Fledge GUI and click on “Add+” in the upper right of the South Services screen.  Fledge will display a series of 3 screens to add the data source:

1. The first screen will ask you to select the plugin for the data source from the list of installed plugins.  If you do not see the plugin you need, refer to the Installing Fledge section of this manual.  In addition, this screen allows you to specify a display name for the data source.
2. The second screen allows you to configure the plugin and the data assets it will provide.  Note that every data asset in Fledge must have a unique name.  If you have multiple sensors using the same plugin, modify the asset names on this screen so they are unique. (Some plugins allow you to specify an asset name prefix that will apply to all the asset names for that sensor.)  Refer to the individual plugin documentation for descriptions of the fields on this screen.  If you modify any of the configuration fields, click on the “save” button to save them.
3. The final screen loads the plugin.  You can specify whether it will be enabled immediately for data collection or to await enabling in the future.

Configuring Data Sources
