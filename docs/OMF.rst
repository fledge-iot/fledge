PI Connector Relay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the Connector Relay, open and sign into the PI Relay Data Connection Manager.

+-----------------+
| |PI_connectors| |
+-----------------+

To add a new connector for the Fledge system, click on the drop down menu to the right of "Connectors" and select "Add an OMF application".  Add and save the requested configuration information.

+--------------+
| |PI_connect| |
+--------------+

Connect the new application to the OMF Connector Relay by selecting the new Fledge application, clicking the check box for the OMF Connector Relay and then clicking "Save Configuration".

+------------+
| |PI_token| |
+------------+

Finally, select the new Fledge application. Click "More" at the bottom of the Configuration panel. Make note of the Producer Token and Relay Ingress URL.

Now go to the Fledge user interface, create a new North instance and select the “OMF” plugin on the first screen.
The second screen will request the following information:

+-------------------------------------+

- Basic Information
   - **Endpoint:** Select what you wish to connect to, in this case the Connector Relay.
   - **Server hostname:** The hostname or address of the Connector Relay.
   - **Server port:** The port the Connector Relay is listening on. Leave as 0 if you are using the default port.
   - **Producer Token:** The Producer Token provided by PI
   - **Data Source:** Defines which data is sent to the PI Server. The readings or Fledge's internal statistics.
   - **Static Data:** Data to include in every reading sent to PI.  For example, you can use this to specify the location of the devices being monitored by the Fledge server.

   - **Sleep Time Retry:** Number of seconds to wait before retrying the HTTP connection (Fledge doubles this time after each failed attempt).
   - **Maximum Retry:** Maximum number of times to retry connecting to the PI server.
   - **HTTP Timeout:** Number of seconds to wait before Fledge will time out an HTTP connection attempt.
- Other (Rarely changed)
   - **Integer Format:** Used to match Fledge data types to the data type configured in PI. This defaults to int64 but may be set to any OMF data type compatible with integer data, e.g. int32.
   - **Number Format:** Used to match Fledge data types to the data type configured in PI. The defaults is float64 but may be set to any OMF datatype that supports floating point values.
   - **Compression:** Compress the readings data before sending it to the PI System.

PI Web API OMF Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the PI Web API OMF endpoint first  ensure the OMF option was included in your PI Server when it was installed.  

Now go to the Fledge user interface, create a new North instance and select the “OMF” plugin on the first screen.
The second screen will request the following information:

Asset Framework Hierarchy Rules
-------------------------------

The asset framework rules allow the location of specific assets within the PI Asset Framework to be controlled. There are two basic type of hint;

- Asset name placement, the name of the asset determines where in the Asset Framework the asset is placed

- Meta data placement, metadata within the reading determines where the asset is placed in the Asset Framework

The rules are encoded within a JSON document, this document contains two properties in the root of the document; one for name based rules and the other for metadata based rules

.. code-block:: console

    {       
	    "names" :       
		    {       
			    "asset1" : "/Building1/EastWing/GroundFloor/Room4",
			    "asset2" : "Room14"
		    },
	    "metadata" :
		    {
			    "exist" :
				    {
					    "temperature"   : "temperatures",
					    "power"         : "/Electrical/Power"
				    },
			    "nonexist" :
				    {
					    "unit"          : "Uncalibrated"
				    }
			    "equal" :
				    {
					    "room"          :
						    {
							    "4" : "ElecticalLab",
							    "6" : "FluidLab"
						    }
				    }
			    "notequal" :
				    {
					    "building"      :
						    {
							    "plant" : "/Office/Environment"
						    }
				    }
		    }
    }

The name type rules are simply a set of asset name and AF location pairs. The asset names must be complete names, there is no pattern matching within the names.

The metadata rules are more complex, four different tests can be applied;

  - **exists**: This test looks for the existence of the named datapoint within the asset.

  - **nonexist**: This test looks for the lack of a named datapoint within the asset.

  - **equal**: This test looks for a named data point having a given value.

  - **notequal**: This test looks for a name data point having a value different from that specified.

The *exist* and *nonexist* tests take a set of name/value pairs that are tested. The name is the datapoint name to examine and the value is the asset framework location to use. For example

.. code-block:: console

   "exist" :
       {
            "temperature"   : "temperatures",
            "power"         : "/Electrical/Power"
       }  

If an asset has a data point called *temperature* in will be stored in the AF hierarchy *temperatures*, if the asset had a data point called *power* the asset will be placed in the AF hierarchy */Electrical/Power*.

The *equal* and *notequal* tests take a object as a child, the name of the object is data point to examine, the child nodes a sets of values and locations. For example

.. code-block:: console

   "equal" :
      {
         "room" :
            {
               "4" : "ElecticalLab",
               "6" : "FluidLab"
            }
      }

In this case if the asset has a data point called *room* with a value of *4* then the asset will be placed in the AF location *ElectricalLab*, if it has a value of *6* then it is placed in the AF location *FluidLab*.

If an asset matches multiple rules in the ruleset it will appear in multiple locations in the hierarchy, the data is shared between each of the locations.

OMF Hints
---------

The OMF plugin also supports the concept of hints in the actual data that determine how the data should be treated by the plugin. Hints are encoded in a specially name data point within the asset, *OMFHint*. The hints themselves are encoded as JSON within a string.

Number Format Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number format hint tells the plugin what number format to insert data into the PI Server as. The following will cause all numeric data within the asset to be written using the format *float32*.

.. code-block:: console

   "OMFHint"  : { "number" : "float32" }

The value of the *number* hint may be any numeric format that is supported by the PI Server.

Datapoint Specific Hint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hints may also be target to specific data points within an asset by using the datapoint hint. A *datapoint* hint takes a JSON object as it's value, this object defines the name of the datapoint and the hnt to apply.

.. code-block:: console

   "OMFHint"  : { "datapoint" : { "name" : "voltage:, "number" : "float32" } }

The above hint applies to the datapoint *voltage* in the asset and applies a *number format* hint to that datapoint.
