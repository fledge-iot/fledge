Test Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objective
+++++++++
This test is specifically designed for basic testing of the `fledge-filter-python35` plugin. It incorporates the use of `fledge-south-http-south` for ingesting data into Fledge via Fogbench and `fledge-filter-expression` to verify Fledge's ability to handle multiple filters in a pipeline alongside `fledge-filter-python35`.

This test consists of eight classes, each containing multiple test case functions:

1. **TestTLSDisabled**:
    Following test case function check functionality of Fledge, when TLS is disabled and auth is not mandatory:
    i. **test_on_default_port**: Verify if Fledge is properly running on the default port.
    ii. **test_on_custom_port**: Verify that Fledge's default HTTP port is successfully changed to a custom port, the service is restarted, and that Fledge is functioning correctly by confirming it is running on the new custom port.
    iii. **test_reset_to_default_port**: Verify that Fledge's HTTP port is changed back to the default port (8081), the service is restarted, and that Fledge is functioning correctly by confirming it is running on the default port.
