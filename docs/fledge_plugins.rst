destination system. A number of north plugins are available ready built
or users may add new north plugins of their own by writing them in Python
or C/C++.

It is also possible, using particular filters, to supply expressions
or script snipets that can operate on the data as well. This provides a
simple way to process the data in Fledge as it is read from devices or
written to destination systems.

with any plugin the user is able to write new plugins in Python or C/C++
to extend the set of notifcation rules.

Notification Delivery Plugins
-----------------------------

Notification delivery plugins provide the mechanisms to deliver the
notification messages to the systems that will receive them.  A number
of notification delivery plugins are available as standard, however as
with any plugin the user is able to write new plugins in Python or C/C++
to extend the set of notifcation rules.

extend the functionality by adding new sources of data, new destinations,
processing filters that can enhance or modify the data, rules for
notification delivery and notification delivery mechanisms.

North Plugins
-------------

North plugins add new destinations to which data may be sent by Fledge. A
number of north plugins are available ready built or users may add new
north plugins of their own by writing them in Python or C/C++.

Filter Plugins
--------------

Filter plugins add new ways in which data may be modified, enhanced
or cleaned as part of the ingress via a south service or egress to a
destination system. A number of north plugins are available ready built
or users may add new north plugins of their own by writing them in Python
or C/C++.

It is also possible, using particular filters, to supply expressions
or script snipets that can operate on the data as well. This provides a
simple way to process the data in Fledge as it is read from devices or
written to destination systems.

Notification Rule Plugins
-------------------------

Notification rule plugins provide the logic that is used by the
notification service to determine if a condition has been met that should
trigger or clear that condition and hence send a notification. A number of
notification plugins are available as standard, however as with any plugin the
user is able to write new plugins in Python or C/C++ to extend the set of
notifcation rules.
