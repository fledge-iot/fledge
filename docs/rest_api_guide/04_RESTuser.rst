******************
User API Reference
******************

The user API provides a mechanism to access the data that is buffered within Fledge. It is designed to allow users and applications to get a view of the data that is available in the buffer and do analysis and possibly trigger actions based on recently received sensor readings.

In order to use the entry points in the user API, with the exception of the ``/fledge/authenticate`` entry point, there must be an authenticated client calling the API. The client must provide a header field in each request, authtoken, the value of which is the token that was retrieved via a call to ``/fledge/authenticate``. This token must be checked for validity and also that the authenticated entity has user or admin permissions.


Browsing Assets
===============


asset
-----

The asset method is used to browse all or some assets, based on search and filtering.


GET all assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``GET /fledge/asset`` - Return an array of asset codes buffered in Fledge and a count of assets by code.


**Response Payload**

An array of JSON objects, one per asset.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 50 30
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Type
      - Description
      - Example
    * - assetCode
      - string
      - The code of the asset
      - fogbench/accelerometer
    * - count
      - number
      - The number of recorded readings for the asset code
      - 180

**Example**

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sX GET http://localhost:8081/fledge/asset
  [ { "count": 18, "assetCode": "fogbench/accelerometer" },
    { "count": 18, "assetCode": "fogbench/gyroscope" },

GET asset readings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``GET /fledge/asset/{code}`` - Return an array of readings for a given asset code.


**Path Parameters**

- **code** - the asset code to retrieve.


**Request Parameters**

  - **limit** - set the limit of the number of readings to return. If not specified, the defaults is 20 readings.
  
  - **skip** - the number of assets to skip. This is used in conjunction with limit and allows the caller to not just get the last N readings, but to get a set of readings from the past.

  - **seconds** - this is essentially an alternative form of limit, but here the limit is expressed in seconds rather than a number of readings. It will return the readings for the last N seconds. Note that this can not be used in conjunction with the *limit* and *skip* or with *hours* and *minutes* request parameters.

  - **minutes** - this is essentially an alternative form of limit, but here the limit is expressed in minutes rather than a number of readings. It will return the readings for the last N minutes. Note that this can not be used in conjunction with the *limit* and *skip* or with *seconds* and *hours* request parameters.

  - **hours** - this is essentially an alternative form of limit, but here the limit is expressed in hours rather than a number of readings. It will return the readings for the last N hours. Note that this can not be used in conjunction with the *limit* and *skip* or with *seconds* and *minutes* request parameters.

  - **previous** - This is used in conjunction with the *hours*, *minutes* or *seconds* request parameter and allows the caller to get not just the most recent readings but historical readings. The value of *previous* is defined in hours, minutes or seconds dependent upon the parameter it is used with and defines how long ago the data that is returned should end. If the caller passes a set of parameters *seconds=30&previous=120* the call will return 30 seconds worth of data and the newest data returned will be 120 seconds old.

**Response Payload**

An array of JSON objects with the readings data for a series of readings sorted in reverse chronological order.
