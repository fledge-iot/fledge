Starting and stopping Fledge
=============================

Fledge administration is performed using the “fledge” command line utility.  You must first ssh into the host system.  The Fledge utility is installed by default in /usr/local/fledge/bin.

The following command options are available:

  - **Start:** Start the Fledge system
  - **Stop:** Stop the Fledge system
  - **Status:** Lists currently running Fledge services and tasks
  - **Reset:** Delete all data and configuration and return Fledge to factory settings
  - **Kill:** Kill Fledge services that have not correctly responded to Stop
  - **Help:** Describe Fledge options

For example, to start the Fledge system, open a session to the Fledge device and type::

/usr/local/fledge/bin/fledge start
