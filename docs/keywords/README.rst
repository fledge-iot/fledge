Keyword Introduction
====================

This file contains a set of files, whose names are keywords found in the plugin
documentation directories. The files are used by the script
*fledge/docs/script/fledge_plugin_list*.

These are used by the script that generates the groupings of plugins by categories,
where a category is a keyword for a given plugin type. 

If a file exists with the keyword in question it will be used as the introduction to
the table of plugins with that keyword.

If there is no file for a given keyword then a standard header is generated.

Adding new keywords in plugin repositories does not necessitate adding
new files in this directory, they are merely here to improve the
documentation. Also, the existence of a file here with a particular name
does not imply that the corresponding keyword is used elsewhere.
