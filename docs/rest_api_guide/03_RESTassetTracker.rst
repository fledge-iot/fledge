Asset Tacker
------------

The *asset tracker* API allows the operations that an asset undergoes whilst traversing the data pipeline within Fledge to be tracked as displayed.

``GET /fledge/track`` - return tracking data for one or more asset

**Parameters**

  - ``asset`` - define the asset to be tracked. If omitted tracking data for all assets is returned

  - ``event`` - the event to track. If omitted all events will be returned

  - ``service`` - limit the tracking data to a particular service

**Response Payload**

An array of tracked events, each of which contains the following

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Type
      - Description
      - Example
    * - asset
      - string
      - The name of the asset for which this track event relates
      - sinusoid
    * - event
      - string
      - The event that was tracked, this will be one of Ingest, Filter or Egress
      - Ingest
    * - service
      - string
      - The name of the service this event was tracked in
      - testSignal4
    * - fledge
      - string
      - The name of the fledge instance this event was tracked in
      - fledge002
    * - plugin
      - string
      - The name of the plugin this event was tracked in
      - sinusoid
    * - timestamp
      - string
      - The timestamp when this event was first tracked
      - 2022-07-06 10:20:13.059
    * - deprecatedTimestamp
      - string
      - The timestamp when this event was deprecated
      - 2022-07-06 10:20:13.059

.. note::

   Asset tracking deprecation allows for old information regarding the plugin that ingested an asset to be hidden when that asset is no longer ingested by the plugin. When this is done the deprecatedTimestamp value is set to be a non-empty timestamp.

**Example**

Return the asset tracking data for the asset called *sinusoid*

.. code-block:: console

   curl http://localhost:8081/fledge/track?asset=sinusoid

Returns

.. code-block:: console

    {
      "track": [
        {
          "asset": "sinusoid",
          "event": "Filter",
          "service": "test1",
          "fledge": "Fledge",
          "plugin": "test2",
          "timestamp": "2022-07-06 10:20:13.059"
        },
        {
          "asset": "sinusoid",
          "event": "Ingest",
          "service": "test1",
          "fledge": "Fledge",
          "plugin": "sinusoid",
          "timestamp": "2022-07-11 16:12:25.749"
        },
        {
          "asset": "sinusoid",
          "event": "Filter",
          "service": "test1",
          "fledge": "Fledge",
          "plugin": "python35",
          "timestamp": "2022-07-13 12:33:10.082"
        },
        {
          "asset": "sinusoid",
          "event": "Egress",
          "service": "OMF",
          "fledge": "Fledge",
          "plugin": "OMF",
          "timestamp": "2022-07-15 14:07:14.950"
        }
      ]
    }

Deprecation
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some circumstances in which old data regarding asset tracking needs to be removed. In particular when a plugin ingests multiple assets or asset names have changed, it is convenient for the user to remove the association with the old asset names.

``PUT /fledge/track/service/service_name/asset/asset_name/event/event_name`` - mark the asset tracking event as deprecated

**Parameters**

  - ``service_name`` - the name of the service for which we want to deprecate the asset tracking event

  - ``asset_name`` - the name of the asset that we should deprecate

  - ``event_name`` - the name of the event to deprecate

.. note::

   There is no API to remove the deprecation of an asset tracking event, this is done automatically when assets are tracked in future events.
